## Message Types

This spec discusses messages in three different formats. The casual phrase "DIDComm message" is ambiguous, but usually refers to DIDComm encrypted messages (the outermost box in the diagram below). These will constitute the vast majority of network traffic in most DIDComm deployments, and they are responsible for security guarantees in the system. However, the role of encrypted messages cannot be understood without reference to the simpler formats they contain.

### Media Types

Media types are based on the conventions of [RFC6838](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838). Similar to [RFC7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.9), the `application/` prefix MAY be omitted and the recipient MUST treat media types not containing `/` as having the `application/` prefix present.

#### DIDComm Plaintext Messages

A DIDComm message in its plaintext form, not packaged into any protective envelope, is known as a **DIDComm plaintext message**. Plaintext messages lack confidentiality and integrity guarantees, and are repudiable. They are therefore not normally transported across security boundaries. However, this may be a helpful format to inspect in debuggers, since it exposes underlying semantics, and it is the format used in this spec to give examples of headers and other internals. Depending on ambient security, plaintext may or may not be an appropriate format for DIDComm data at rest.

When higher-level protocols are built atop DIDComm, applications remove the protective envelope(s) and process the plaintext that's inside. Specs for higher-level protocols typically document message structure and provide examples in this format; protective envelopes are assumed but ignored as a low-level detail.

The media type for a generic DIDComm plaintext message MUST be `application/didcomm-plain+json`. DIDComm plaintext messages are also correctly understood as JWM content (see [Plaintext Message Structure](#plaintext-message-structure), below) and the media type MUST be set in the `typ` [property](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.9) of the DIDComm plaintext message header.

When persisted as a file or attached as a payload in other contexts, the file extension for DIDComm plaintext messages SHOULD be `dcpm`, giving a globbing pattern of `*.dcpm`; this SHOULD be be read as "Star Dot D C P M" or as "D C P M" files. We imagine people will reference this media type by saying, "I am looking at a DIDComm Plaintext Message file", or "This database record is in DIDComm Plaintext format", or "Does my editor have a DIDComm Plaintext Message plugin?" A possible icon for this file format depicts green JSON text in a message bubble ([svg](../collateral/dcpm.svg) | [256x256](../collateral/dcpm-256.png) | [128x128](../collateral/dcpm-128.png) | [64x64](../collateral/dcpm-64.png)):

![DIDComm Plaintext Message Icon](../collateral/dcpm-128.png)

#### DIDComm Signed Message

A **DIDComm signed message** is a signed [JWM (JSON Web Messages)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-looker-jwm-01) envelope that associates a non-repudiable signature with the plaintext message inside it.

Signed messages are not necessary to provide message integrity (tamper evidence), or to prove the sender to the recipient. Both of these guarantees automatically occur with the authenticated encryption in DIDComm encrypted messages. Signed messages are only necessary when the origin of plaintext must be provable to third parties, or when the sender can't be proven to the recipient by authenticated encryption because the recipient is not known in advance (e.g., in a broadcast scenario). Adding a signature when one is not needed [can degrade rather than enhance security because it relinquishes the sender's ability to speak off the record](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0049-repudiation/README.md#summary). We therefore expect signed messages to be used in a few cases, but not as a matter of course.

When a message is *both* signed and encrypted, the plaintext is signed, and then the signed envelope is encrypted. The opposite order is not used, since it would imply that the signer committed to opaque data (which is unsafe and undermines non-repudiation).

The [media type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838) of a DIDComm signed message MUST be `application/didcomm-signed+json`.

The media type of the envelope MUST be set in the `typ` [property](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.9) of the JWS.

When persisted as a file or attached as a payload in other contexts, the file extension for DIDComm signed messages SHOULD be `dcsm`, giving a globbing pattern of `*.dcsm`; this SHOULD be be read as "Star Dot D C S M" or as "D C S M" files. A possible icon for this media type depicts a signed envelope ([svg](../collateral/dcsm.svg) | [256x256](../collateral/dcsm-256.png) | [128x128](../collateral/dcsm-128.png) | [64x64](../collateral/dcsm-64.png)):

![DIDComm Signed Message Icon](../collateral/dcsm-128.png)

#### DIDComm Encrypted Message

A **DIDComm encrypted message** is an encrypted [JWM (JSON Web Messages)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-looker-jwm-01) and hides its content from all but authorized recipients, discloses and proves the sender to exactly and only those recipients, and provides integrity guarantees. It is important in privacy-preserving routing. It is what normally moves over network transports in DIDComm applications, and is the safest format for storing DIDComm data at rest.

 The [media type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838) of a DIDComm encrypted non-nested message MUST be `application/didcomm-encrypted+json`.

>Note: If future versions of this spec allow binary encodings, variations like `application/didcomm-encrypted+cbor` (see [CBOR RFC 7049, section 7.5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-7.5)), `application/didcomm-encrypted+msgpack`, or `application/didcomm-encrypted+protobuf` may become reasonable. Future DIDComm specs that encompass comm patterns other than messaging &mdash; DIDComm multicast or DIDComm streaming, for example &mdash; might use a suffix: `application/didcomm-encrypted-multicast` or similar.

The media type of the envelope MUST be set in the `typ` [property](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516#section-4.1.11) of the JWE.

When persisted as a file or attached as a payload in other contexts, the file extension for DIDComm encrypted messages SHOULD be `dcem`, giving a globbing pattern of `*.dcem`; this SHOULD be be read as "Star Dot D C E M" or as "D C E M" files. A possible icon for this file format depicts an envelope with binary overlay, protected by a lock ([svg](../collateral/dcem.svg) | [256x256](../collateral/dcem-256.png) | [128x128](../collateral/dcem-128.png) | [64x64](../collateral/dcem-64.png)):

### Examples

The following table provides an overview of examples for using the media type properties in various 
DIDComm messages:

| DIDComm message | `typ` |
|-----------------|-------|
| Encrypted | `application/didcomm-encrypted+json`|
| Signed, then encrypted | `application/didcomm-encrypted+json`|
| Encrypted, then encrypted | `application/didcomm-encrypted+json` |
| Signed | `application/didcomm-signed+json` |
| Plaintext | `application/didcomm-plain+json`|

## Negotiating Compatibility

When parties want to communicate via DIDComm, a number of mechanisms must align. These include:

1. The type of service endpoint used by each party
2. The key types used for encryption and/or signing
3. The format of the encryption and/or signing envelopes
4. The encoding of plaintext messages
5. The protocol used to forward and route
6. The protocol embodied in the plaintext messages

Although DIDComm allows flexibility in each of these choices, it is not expected that a given DIDComm implementation will support many permutations. Rather, we expect a few sets of choices that commonly go together. We call a set of choices that work well together a __profile__. Profiles are identified by a string that matches the conventions of IANA media types, but they express choices about plaintext, encryption, signing, and routing in a single value. The following profile identifiers are defined in this version of the spec:

### Defined Profiles

* `didcomm/aip1`: The encryption envelope, signing mechanism, plaintext conventions, and routing algorithms embodied in Aries AIP 1.0, circa 2020.
* `didcomm/aip2;env=rfc19`: The signing mechanism, plaintext conventions, and routing algorithms embodied in Aries AIP 2.0, circa 2021 -- with the old-style encryption envelope from Aries RFC 0019. This legal variant of AIP 2.0 minimizes differences with codebases that shipped AIP 1.0 support.
* `didcomm/aip2;env=rfc587`: The signing mechanism, plaintext conventions, and routing algorithms embodied in Aries AIP 2.0, circa 2021 -- with the new-style encryption envelope from Aries RFC 0587. This legal variant of AIP 2.0 lays the foundation for DIDComm v2 support by anticipating the eventual envelope change.
* `didcomm/v2`: The encryption envelope, signing mechanism, plaintext conventions, and routing algorithms embodied in this spec.

Profiles are named in the `accept` section of a DIDComm service endpoint and in an out-of-band message. When Alice declares that she accepts `didcomm/v2`, she is making a declaration about more than her own endpoint. She is saying that all publicly visible steps in an inbound route to her will use the `didcomm/v2` profile, such that a sender only has to use `didcomm/v2` choices to get the message from Alice's outermost mediator to Alice's edge. It is up to Alice to select and configure mediators and internal routing in such a way that this is true for the sender.

## Plaintext Message Structure

DIDComm plaintext messages are based on [JWM (JSON Web Messages)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-looker-jwm-01). A message has a basic structure that specifies the message type, id, and other attributes common to all messages. These common attributes appear at the top level of a DIDComm message, and are called headers. A message also includes attributes specific to the message type. Type specific message attributes are contained within the `body` attribute of a message.

Prior to being sent to a recipient, the JWM is usually encrypted into a JWE according to the JWM spec.

The following example shows common elements of a plaintext message. Further details and advanced usage are covered elsewhere in this spec.

```json
{
    "typ": "application/didcomm-plain+json",
    "id": "1234567890",
    "type": "<message-type-uri>",
    "from": "did:example:alice",
    "to": ["did:example:bob"],
    "created_time": 1516269022,
    "expires_time": 1516385931,
    "body": {
    	"messagespecificattribute": "and its value"
	}
}
```

### Message Headers

The predefined attributes of a DIDComm plaintext message at the level of its outer packaging (effectively, the "headers" of the message) are as follows:

- **typ** - OPTIONAL. Media type of the JWM content and MUST be set to `application/didcomm-plain+json` for **DIDComm plaintext messages**.

- **id** - REQUIRED. Message ID. The `id` attribute value MUST be unique to the sender.

- **type** - REQUIRED. Message Type. The `type` attribute value MUST be a valid [Message Type URI](protocols.md#message-type-uri), that when resolved gives human readable information about the message. The attribute's value also informs the content of the message, for example the presence of other attributes and how they should be processed.

- **to** - OPTIONAL. Identifier(s) for recipients. MUST be an array of strings where each element is a valid DID or [DID URL](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#did-url-syntax) (without the [fragment component](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#fragment)) that identifies a member of the message's intended audience.

    When Alice sends the same message to Bob and Carol, it is by inspecting this header that Bob and Carol learn that the message was sent to both of them. If the header is omitted, each recipient can only assume they are the only recipient (much like an email sent only to `BCC:` addresses).
    
    The `to` header cannot be used for routing, since it is encrypted at every intermediate point in a route. Instead, the `forward` message contains a `next` attribute in its body that specifies the target for the next routing operation.

- **from** - OPTIONAL. Sender identifier. The `from` attribute MUST be a string that is a valid DID or [DID URL](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#did-url-syntax) (without the [fragment component](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#fragment)) which identifies the sender of the message. When a message is encrypted, the sender key MUST be authorized for encryption by this DID. Authorization of the encryption key for this DID MUST be verified by message recipient with the proper proof purposes. See the [message authentication](#Message-Authentication) section for additional details.

    When the sender wishes to be anonymous, they should use a new DID created for the purpose to avoid correlation with any other behavior or identity. Peer DIDs are lightweight and require no ledger writes, and therefore a good method to use for this purpose.

- **created_time** - OPTIONAL. Message Created Time. The `created_time` attribute is used for the sender to express when they created the message, expressed in UTC Epoch Seconds (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC) [link](1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC). This attribute is informative to the recipient, and may be relied on by protocols.

- **expires_time** - OPTIONAL. Message Expired Time. The `expires_time` attribute is used for the sender to express when they consider the message to be expired, expressed in UTC Epoch Seconds (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC) [link](1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC). This attribute signals when the message is considered no longer valid by the sender. When omitted, the message is considered to have no expiration by the sender. 

In the outer packaging of message metadata, DIDComm follows the extensibility pattern established by the JW* family of standards. (It also emulates the design of message headers in SMTP, request headers in HTTP, and labels on physical pieces of mail.) A modest inventory of predefined "header" fields is specified, as shown above. Additional fields with unreserved names can be added at the discretion of producers and consumers of messages; any software that doesn't understand such fields should ignore them and MUST NOT fail because of their inclusion in a message. This is appropriate for a simple, flat data model.

Aligning with [RFC 6648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648.html), DIDComm explicitly rejects the `X-*` headers convention that creates divergent pseudo-standards; if a new header needs broad support, it must be standardized properly. Alternatively, a JSON-LD `@context` header can be added, providing namespacing for fields other than those predefined in the spec. Since we expect header fields to be small in number and modest in complexity, we expect this sort of powerful extensibility to be unnecessary in most cases.

#### Simple vs. Structured

Headers can be simple (mapping a header name to an integer or a string) or structured (mapping a header name to JSON substructure -- an array or JSON object). When defining a new header type, the following guidelines apply:

* Headers SHOULD NOT use more structure than necessary; simple headers are preferred.
* However, a header value SHOULD NOT require interpretation over and above ordinary JSON parsing. Prefer JSON structure to specialized string DSLs like the one that encodes media type preferences in an HTTP `Accept` header. ([HTTP Structured Headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-15) provide similar functionality but are unnecessary here, since DIDComm plaintext already has an easily parseable syntax.)
* Headers that are only meaningful together SHOULD be grouped into a JSON object.

#### Relationship to JSON-LD

The problem domain of DIDComm intersects with other aspects of decentralized identity, where JSON-LD plays a role in some standards. Thus it may be natural to wonder about DIDComm's relationship to JSON-LD and to the rich semantics and extensibility features it offers. The short answer is that DIDComm is not dependent on JSON-LD, but it is compatible with it. We expect these two technologies to remain mostly orthogonal.

The body of a message -- everything inside the `body` object -- is different. Here, there is substantial variety and complexity. Structures may be sophisticated graphs, represented with nested objects and arrays. JSON-LD is not required at this level, either. However, it is available, and may be appropriate for certain use cases where extensibility is an important feature. JSON-LD usage, if it occurs, SHOULD be a declared feature of a protocol as a whole, not an ad hoc extension to arbitrary individual messages, and MUST be signalled by the inclusion of a `@context` inside `body`. Unless a protocol declares a JSON-LD dependency, the same rules apply to JSON-LD-isms as apply to any other unrecognized structure in a DIDComm message: additional fields can be added to any part of message structure, should be ignored if not understood, and MUST NOT be the basis of failure by recipients.

### DID Rotation

DIDComm is based on DIDs and their associated DID Documents. Changes to keys and endpoints are the concern of each DID method and are utilized but not managed by DIDComm. DID Rotation serves a very specific and narrow need to switch from one DID method to another. This is very common at the beginning of a new DIDComm relationship when a public DID or a temporary DID passed unencrypted is rotated out for a DID chosen for the relationship. As rotation between one DID and another is outside the scope of any DID method, the details of DID Rotation are handled within DIDComm itself.

When a DID is rotated, the new DID is put into immediate use encrypting the message, and one additional attribute is included as a message header:

- **from_prior**: A JWT, with with `sub`: new DID and `iss`: prior DID, with a signature from a key authorized by prior DID.

When a message is received from an unknown DID, the recipient should check for existence of the `from_prior` header. The JWT in the`from_prior` attribute is used to extract the prior DID (`iss`) and is checked to verify the validity of the rotation. The recipient then associates the message with context related to the known sender. The new DID and associated DID Document information should be used for further communication.

The validity of the DID rotation is verified by checking the JWT signature against the key indicated in the `kid` header parameter. The indicated key MUST be authorized in the DID Document of the prior DID (`iss`).

The `from_prior` attribute should be included in messages sent until the party rotating receives a message sent to the new DID. If multiple messages are received to containing the rotation headers after being processed by the recipient, they may be ignored.

#### JWT Details

The JWT is constructed as follows, with appropriate values changed.

**Header**:

```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "crv": "ED25519",
  "kid": "<key id authorized in prior DID>"
}
```

**Payload**:

```jsonc
{
  "sub": "<new DID URI>",
  "iss": "<prior DID URI>",
  "iat": 1516239022 //datetime of the rotation, not message
}
```

#### Example Message Rotating DID

```json
{
    "typ": "application/didcomm-plain+json",
    "id": "1234567890",
    "type": "<message-type-uri>",
    "from": "did:example:alice2",
    "from_prior": "<JWT with sub:did:example:alice2 and iss:did:example:alice>",
    "to": ["did:example:bob"],
    "created_time": 1516269022,
    "expires_time": 1516385931,
    "body": {
    	"messagespecificattribute": "and its value"
	}
}
```

#### Rotation Limitations

- This rotation method does not cover cases where a multi-sig is required. Rotations with such requirements should use a more expressive protocol.
- This rotation method only supports the case where a new DID is used, replacing an old DID which is no longer used. Adjustments to DIDs used between different parties that does not fit this narrow use should use a more expressive protocol.
