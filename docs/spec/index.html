<h2 id="purpose-and-scope"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#purpose-and-scope">§</a> Purpose and Scope</h2>
<p>The purpose of DIDComm is to provide a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>.</p>
<p>Other robust mechanisms for secure communication already exist. However, most rely on key registries, identity providers, certificate authorities, browser or app vendors, or similarly centralized assumptions. They also tend to be tied to a single transport, making it difficult to use the same solution for human and machine conversations, online and offline, simplex and duplex, across a broad set of modalities. The net result is that they perpetuate an asymmetry between institutions and ordinary people. The former maintain certificates and always-connected servers, and publish APIs under terms and conditions they dictate; the latter suffer with usernames and passwords, poor interoperability, and a Hobson’s choice between privacy and convenience.</p>
<p>DIDComm can fix this. Using DIDComm, individuals on semi-connected mobile devices become full peers of highly available web servers operated by IT experts. Registration is self-service, intermediaries require little trust, and no terms and conditions apply.</p>
<p>DIDComm enables higher-order protocols that inherit its security, privacy, decentralization, and transport independence. Examples include exchanging verifiable credentials, creating and maintaining relationships, buying and selling, scheduling events, negotiating contracts, voting, presenting tickets for travel, applying to employers or schools or banks, arranging healthcare, and playing games. Like web services atop HTTP, the possibilities are endless; unlike web services atop HTTP, many parties can participate without being clients of a central server, and they can use a mixture of connectivity models and technologies.</p>
<h3 id="overview"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#overview">§</a> Overview</h3>
<p>To understand how DIDComm works, consider a situation where Alice wants to negotiate with Bob to sell something online. Because DIDComm, not direct human communication, is the methodology in this example, Alice’s software agent and Bob’s software agent are going to exchange a series of messages.</p>
<p>Alice may just press a button and be unaware of details, but underneath, her agent begins by preparing a plaintext JSON message about the proposed sale. (The particulars are irrelevant here, but would be described in the spec for a higher-level “sell something” protocol that takes DIDComm as its foundation.) Alice’s agent then looks up Bob’s DID Doc to access two key pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>An endpoint (web, email, etc) where messages can be delivered to Bob.</li>
<li>The public key that Bob’s agent is using in the Alice:Bob relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Alice’s agent uses Bob’s public key to encrypt the plaintext so that only Bob’s agent can read it, adding authentication with its own private key. The agent arranges delivery to Bob. This “arranging” can involve various hops and intermediaries. It can be complex. (See <a href="/guide#routing">Routing in the Implementers Guide</a>.)</p>
<p>Bob’s agent eventually receives and decrypts the message, authenticating its origin as Alice using her public key. It prepares its response and routes it back using a reciprocal process (plaintext → lookup endpoint and public key for Alice → encrypt with authentication → arrange delivery).</p>
<p>That’s the essence, in the most common scenarios. However, it does not fit all DIDComm interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>DIDComm doesn’t always involve turn-taking and request-response.</li>
<li>DIDComm interactions can involve more than 2 parties, and the parties are not always individuals.</li>
<li>DIDComm may include formats other than JSON.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we provide more details, let’s explore what drives the design of DIDComm.</p>
<h3 id="specific-requirements"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#specific-requirements">§</a> Specific Requirements</h3>
<p>The DIDComm design attempts to be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Secure</strong> (tamper-proof; uses best-of-breed crypto; allows parties to talk both on and off the record…)</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong> (third parties can’t learn who’s communicating about what, when; lets sender be anonymous to recipient)</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized</strong> (derives trust for encryption, signing, authn, and authz from control of DIDs rather than oracles like CAs, IDPs, etc; usable at the edge)</li>
<li><strong>Transport-agnostic</strong> (usable over HTTPS 1.x and 2.0, WebSockets, BlueTooth, chat, push notifications, AMQP, SMTP, NFC, sneakernet, snail mail; supports both simplex and duplex; works offline; doesn’t assume client-server or synchronous or real-time; allows paired or n-wise or public broadcast usage)</li>
<li><strong>Routable</strong> (like email, A can talk to B without a direct connection to B; allows mixed and dynamic transports; passes through mix networks and other generic infrastructure that sees only payload BLOBs)</li>
<li><strong>Interoperable</strong> (works across programming languages, blockchains, vendors, OS/platforms, networks, legal jurisdictions, geos, cryptographies, and hardware–as well as across time; avoids vendor lock-in)</li>
<li><strong>Extensible</strong> (lets devs start simple without heavy learning or dependencies; customize easily; facilitates higher-level protocols that inherit DIDComm’s guarantees)</li>
<li><strong>Efficient</strong> (doesn’t waste bandwidth, battery, storage space, or CPU)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ramifications"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#ramifications">§</a> Ramifications</h3>
<p>As a list of buzz words, this may elicit nods rather than surprise. However, design tradeoffs are inevitable, and several of these items have noteworthy ramifications.</p>
<h4 id="message-based-asynchronous-and-simplex"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#message-based-asynchronous-and-simplex">§</a> Message-Based, Asynchronous, and Simplex</h4>
<p>The dominant paradigm in mobile and web development today is duplex request-response. You call an API with certain inputs, and you get back a response with certain outputs over the same channel, shortly thereafter. This is the world of <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/">OpenAPI (Swagger)</a>, and it has many virtues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many agents are not good analogs to web servers. They may be mobile devices that turn off at unpredictable intervals and that lack a stable connection to the network. They may need to work peer-to-peer, when the internet is not available. They may need to interact in time frames of hours or days, not with 30-second timeouts. They may not listen over the same channel that they use to talk.</p>
<p>Because of this, the fundamental paradigm for DIDComm is message-based, asynchronous, and simplex. Agent X sends a message over channel A. Sometime later, it may receive a response from Agent Y over channel B. This is much closer to an email paradigm than a web paradigm.</p>
<p>On top of this foundation, it is possible to build elegant, synchronous request-response interactions. All of us have interacted with a friend who’s emailing or texting us in near-realtime. However, interoperability begins with a least-common-denominator assumption that’s simpler.</p>
<h4 id="message-level-security-reciprocal-authentication"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#message-level-security-reciprocal-authentication">§</a> Message-Level Security, Reciprocal Authentication</h4>
<p>The security and privacy goals, and the asynchronous+simplex design decision, break familiar web assumptions in another way. Servers are commonly run by institutions, and we authenticate them with certificates. People and things are usually authenticated to servers by some sort of login process quite different from certificates, and this authentication is cached in a session object that expires. Furthermore, web security is provided at the transport level (TLS); it is not an independent attribute of the messages themselves.</p>
<p>In a partially disconnected world where a communication channel is not assumed to support duplex request-response, and where the security can’t be ignored as a transport problem, traditional TLS, login, and expiring sessions are impractical. Furthermore, centralized servers and certificate authorities perpetuate a power and UX imbalance between servers and clients that doesn’t fit with the peer-oriented DIDComm.</p>
<p>DIDComm uses public key cryptography, not certificates from some parties and passwords from others. Its security guarantees are independent of the transport over which it flows. It is sessionless (though sessions can <em>easily</em> be built atop it). When authentication is required, all parties do it the same way.</p>
<h3 id="processing-model"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#processing-model">§</a> Processing Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>Message-oriented, with sender and receiver(s)</li>
<li>Encryption Envelope</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="message-structure"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#message-structure">§</a> Message Structure</h2>
<p>DIDComm Messages are based on JWM (JSON Web Messages). A message has a basic structure that specifies the message type, id, and other attributes common to all messages. These common attributes appear at the top level of a DIDComm message, and are called headers. A message also includes attributes specific to the message type. Type specific message attributes are contained within the <code>body</code> attribute of a message.</p>
<p>Prior to being sent to a recipient, the JWM is encrypted into a JWE according to the JWM spec.</p>
<p>The following example shows common elements of a DIDComm Message. Further details and advanced usage are covered elsewhere in this spec.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The attributes of a DIDComm Message at the level of its outer packaging (effectively, the “headers” of the message) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong> - REQUIRED. Message ID. The <code>id</code> attribute value MUST be unique to the sender.</li>
<li><strong>type</strong> - REQUIRED. Message Type. The <code>type</code> attribute value MUST be a valid <a href="protocols.md#message-type-uri">Message Type URI</a> , that when resolved gives human readable information about the message. The attributes value also informs the content of the message, for example the presence of other attributes and how they should be processed.</li>
<li><strong>to</strong> - OPTIONAL. Recipient(s) identifier. The <code>to</code> attribute MUST be an array of strings where each element is a valid <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#generic-did-syntax">DID</a> which identifies the recipients of the message.</li>
<li><strong>from</strong> - OPTIONAL. Sender identifier. The <code>from</code> attribute MUST be a string that is a valid <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#generic-did-syntax">DID</a> which identifies the sender of the message. For DID methods that use query parameters to carry additional information, they might also be present in the from string. When a message is encrypted, the sender key MUST be authorized for encryption by this DID. Authorization of the encryption key for this DID MUST be verified by message recipient with the proper proof purposes. See the <a href="#Message-Authentication">message authentication</a> section for additional details.</li>
<li><strong>created_time</strong> - OPTIONAL. Message Created Time. The <code>created_time</code> attribute is used for the sender to express when they created the message, expressed in UTC Epoch Seconds (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC) [link](1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC). This attribute is informative to the recipient, and may be relied on by protocols.</li>
<li><strong>expires_time</strong> - OPTIONAL. Message Expired Time. The <code>expires_time</code> attribute is used for the sender to express when they consider the message to be expired, expressed in UTC Epoch Seconds (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC) [link](1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC). This attribute signals when the message is no longer valid, and is to be used by the recipient to discard expired messages on receipt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem domain of DIDComm intersects with other aspects of decentralized identity, where JSON-LD plays a role in some standards. Thus it may be natural to wonder about DIDComm’s relationship to JSON-LD and to the rich semantics and extensibility features it offers. The short answer is that DIDComm is not dependent on JSON-LD, but it is compatible with it. We expect these two technologies to remain mostly orthogonal.</p>
<p>In the outer packaging of message metadata, DIDComm follows the extensibility pattern established by the JW* family of standards. (It also emulates the design of message headers in SMTP, request headers in HTTP, and labels on physical pieces of mail.) A modest inventory of predefined “header” fields is specified, as shown above. Additional fields with unreserved names can be added at the discretion of producers and consumers of messages; any software that doesn’t understand such fields should ignore them and MUST NOT fail because of their inclusion in a message. This is appropriate for a simple, flat data model.</p>
<p>Aligning with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648.html">RFC 6648</a>, DIDComm explicitly rejects the <code>X-*</code> headers convention that creates divergent pseudo-standards; if a new header needs broad support, it must be standardized properly. Alternatively, a JSON-LD <code>@context</code> header can be added, providing namespacing for fields other than those predefined in the spec. Since we expect header fields to be small in number and modest in complexity, we expect this sort of powerful extensibility to be unnecessary in most cases.</p>
<p>The body of a message – everything inside the <code>body</code> object – is different. Here, there is substantial variety and complexity. Structures may be sophisticated graphs, represented with nested objects and arrays. JSON-LD is not required at this level, either. However, it is available, and may be appropriate for certain use cases where extensibility is an important feature. JSON-LD usage, if it occurs, SHOULD be a declared feature of a protocol as a whole, not an ad hoc extension to arbitrary individual messages, and MUST be signalled by the inclusion of a <code>@context</code> inside <code>body</code>. Unless a protocol declares a JSON-LD dependency, the same rules apply to JSON-LD-isms as apply to any other unrecognized structure in a DIDComm message: additional fields can be added to any part of message structure, should be ignored if not understood, and MUST NOT be the basis of failure by recipients.</p>
<h3 id="did-rotation"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#did-rotation">§</a> DID Rotation</h3>
<p>DIDComm is based on DIDs and their associated DID Documents. Changes to keys and endpoints are the concern of each DID method and are utilized but not managed by DIDComm. DID Rotation serves a very specific and narrow need to switch from one DID method to another. This is very common at the beginning of a new DIDComm relationship when a public DID or a temporary DID passed unencrypted is rotated out for a DID chosen for the relationship. As rotation between one DID and another is outside the scope of any DID method, the details of DID Rotation are handled within DIDComm itself.</p>
<p>When a DID is rotated, the new DID is put into immediate use encrypting the message, and one additional attribute is included as a message header:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>from_prior</strong>: A JWT, with with <code>sub</code>: new DID and <code>iss</code>: prior DID, with a signature from a key authorized by prior DID.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a message is received from an unknown DID, the recipient should check for existence of the <code>from_prior</code> header. The JWT in the<code>from_prior</code> attribute is used to extract the prior DID (<code>iss</code>) and is checked to verify the validity of the rotation. The recipient then associates the message with context related to the known sender. The new DID and associated DID Document information should be used for further communication.</p>
<p>The validity of the DID rotation is verified by checking the JWT signature against the key indicated in the <code>kid</code> header parameter. The indicated key MUST be authorized in the DID Document of the prior DID (<code>iss</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>from_prior</code> attribute should be included in messages sent until the party rotating receives a message sent to the new DID. If multiple messages are received to containing the rotation headers after being processed by the recipient, they may be ignored.</p>
<h4 id="jwt-details"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#jwt-details">§</a> JWT Details</h4>

<li>This rotation method does not cover cases where a multi-sig is required. Rotations with such requirements should use a more expressive protocol.</li>
<li>This rotation method only supports the case where a new DID is used, replacing an old DID which is no longer used. Adjustments to DIDs used between different parties that does not fit this narrow use should use a more expressive protocol.</li>

<h2 id="message-encryption"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#message-encryption">§</a> Message Encryption</h2>
<p>DIDComm supports two types of message encryption: Authenticated Sender Encryption and Anonymous Sender Encryption. Both forms are encrypted to the recipient, but only Authenticated Sender Encryption provides assurances of who the sender is.</p>
<p>The encrypted form of a JWM is a JWE. The JOSE family defines <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">JSON Web Algorithms</a> (JWAs) which standardize certain cryptographic operations that are related to preparing JOSE structures. For the purposes of interoperability, DIDComm messaging does not support all JWAs, rather it takes a subset of the supported algorithms that are applicable for the following cases around secure messaging. These supported algorithms are listed here.</p>

<h3 id="routing-protocol"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#routing-protocol">§</a> Routing Protocol</h3>
<h4 id="name-and-version"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#name-and-version">§</a> Name and Version</h4>
<p>The name of this protocol is “Routing Protocol”, and its <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/semver.md">version</a> is “2.0”. It is uniquely identified by the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/uris.md#piuri">PIURI</a>:</p>
<pre><code>https://didcomm.org/routing/2.0
</code></pre>
<h4 id="roles"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#roles">§</a> Roles</h4>
<p>There are 3 roles in the protocol: <code>sender</code>, <code>mediator</code>, and <code>recipient</code>. The sender emits messages of type <code>forward</code> to the <code>mediator</code>. The mediator unpacks (decrypts) the payload of an encrypted <code>forward</code> message and passes on the result (an opaque blob that probably contains a differently encrypted payload) to the <code>recipient</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/collateral/routing-roles.png" alt="ordinary sequence"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the protocol is one-way; the return route for communication might not exist at all, or if it did, it could invert the roles of sender and receiver and use the same mediator, or it could use one or more different mediators, or it could use no mediator at all. This is a separate concern partly specified by the service endpoints in the DID docs of the sender and receiver, and partly explored in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0092-transport-return-route/README.md">RFC 0092: Transports Return Route</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: When the mediator is the routing agent of a single identity subject like Alice, the logical receiver is Alice herself, but the physical receiver may manifest as multiple edge devices (a phone, a laptop, a tablet). From the perspective of this protocol, multiplexing the send from mediator to receiver is out of scope for interoperability–compatible and fully supported, but not required or specified in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this protocol, the sender and the receiver never interact directly; they only interact via the mediator.</p>
<p>The sender can decorate the <code>forward</code> message in standard DIDComm ways: using <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0032-message-timing/README.md#tutorial"><code>~timing.expires_time</code>, <code>~timing.delay_milli</code> and <code>~timing.wait_until_time</code></a> to introduce timeouts and delays, and so forth. However, the mediator is NOT required to support or implement any of these mixin semantics; only the core forwarding behavior is indispensable. If a mediator sees a decorator that requests behavior it doesn’t support, it MAY return a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0035-report-problem/README.md"><code>problem-report</code></a> to the sender identifying the unsupported feature, but it is not required to do so, any more than other recipients of DIDComm messages would be required to complain about unsupported decorators in messages they receive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One particular decorator is worth special mention here: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0015-acks/README.md#requesting-an-ack-please_ack"><code>~please_ack</code></a>. This decorator is intended to be processed by ultimate recipients, not mediators. It imposes a burden of backward-facing communication that mediators should not have. Furthermore, it may be used to probe a delivery chain in a way that risks privacy for the receiver. Therefore, senders SHOULD NOT use this, and mediators SHOULD NOT honor it if present. If a sender wishes to troubleshoot, the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0034-message-tracing/README.md">message tracing</a> mechanism is recommended.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="states"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#states">§</a> States</h4>
<p>Since data flow is normally one-way, and since the scope of the protocol is a single message delivery, a simplistic way to understand it might be as two instances of the stateless <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/notification.png">notification pattern</a>, unfolding in sequence.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t quite work on close inspection, because the mediator is at least potentially stateful with respect to any particular message; it needs to be if it wants to implement delayed delivery or retry logic. (Or, as noted earlier, the possibility of sending to multiple physical receivers. Mediators are not required to implement any of these features, but the state machine needs to account for their possibility.) Plus, the notification terminology obscures the sender and receiver roles. So we use the following formalization:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zxm3cPZ1UDQPDpYJjGmg_qY8451WMk105HBSARJkvDI/edit#gid=0"><img src="/collateral/routing-state-machines.png" alt="state machines"></a></p>
<h4 id="messages"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#messages">§</a> Messages</h4>
<p>The only message in this protocol is the <code>forward</code> message. A simple and common version of a <code>forward</code> message might look like this:</p>

<p>[TODO: describe use of the <code>attn</code> field, and explain why it’s an important construct that allows us to encrypt to all (cryptographic route) but deliver just to the agent most likely to be interested (network route).</p>
<p>[TODO: further revise the following paragraph to clarify that either a key or a DID might be used. Each possibility makes certain tradeoffs, and may be appropriate in certain cases. Keys may be fragile in the face of rotation, and they require a lot of knowledge/maintenance cost for the external mediator. However, DID key references and DIDs may introduce some complications in how the recipient proves control of a DID (a requirement for security, but also a privacy eroder).]</p>
<p>For most external mediators, the value of the <code>to</code> field is likely to be a DID, not a key. However… (see previous TODO note). This hides details about the internals of a sovereign domain from external parties. The sender will have had to multiplex encrypt for all relevant recipient keys, but doesn’t need to know how routing happens to those keys. The mediator and the receiver may have coordinated about how distribution to individual keys takes place (see <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0211-route-coordination/README.md">RFC 0211: Route Coordination</a>), but that is outside the scope of concerns of this protocol.</p>
<p>The attachment(s) in the <code>payloads~attach</code> field are able to use the full power of DIDComm attachments, including features like instructing the receiver to download the payload content from a CDN.</p>
<p>The <code>mix</code> property is discussed next.</p>
<h4 id="rewrapping"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#rewrapping">§</a> Rewrapping</h4>
<p>Normally, the payload attached to the <code>forward</code> message received by the mediator is transmitted directly to the receiver with no further packaging. However, optionally, the mediator can attach the opaque payload to a new <code>forward</code> message, which then acts as a fresh outer envelope for the second half of the delivery. This <a href="#rewrapping">rewrapping</a> means that the “onion” of packed messages stays the same size rather than getting smaller as a result of the forward operation:</p>
<p><img src="/collateral/routing-roles-2.png" alt="re-wrapped sequence"></p>
<p>Rewrapping mode is invisible to senders, but mediators need to know about it, since they change their behavior as a result. Receivers also need to know about it, because it causes them to receive a double-packaged message instead of a singly-packaged one. The outer envelope is a <code>forward</code> message where <code>to</code> is the receiver itself.</p>
<p>Why is such indirection useful?</p>
<ul>
<li>It lets the mediator decorate messages with its own timing and tracing mixins, which may aid troubleshooting. (This would otherwise be impossible, since the inner payload is an opaque blob that almost certainly tamper-evident and encrypted.)</li>
<li>It lets the mediator remain uncommitted to whether the next receiver is another mediator or not. This may provide flexibility in some routing scenarios.</li>
<li>It lets the mediator change the size of the message by adding or subtracting noise from the content.</li>
<li>It allows for dynamic routing late in the delivery chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>These last two characteristics are the foundation of mix networking feature for DIDComm. That feature is the subject of a different RFC; here we only note the existence of the optional feature.</p>

<p><strong>serviceEndpoint</strong>: MUST contain a URI for a transport specified in the [transports] section of this spec, or a URI from Alternative Endpoints. It MAY be desirable to constraint endpoints from the [transports] section so that they are used only for the reception of DIDComm messages. This can be particularly helpful in cases where auto-detecting message types is inefficient or undesirable.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-endpoints"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#multiple-endpoints">§</a> Multiple Endpoints</h4>
<p>A DID Document may contain multiple service entries of type <code>DIDComm</code>. Entries are SHOULD be specified in order of receiver preference, but any endpoint MAY be selected by the sender, typically by protocol availability or preference.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-endpoints"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#alternative-endpoints">§</a> Alternative Endpoints</h4>
<p>In addition to the URIs for [transports], some alternative forms are available.</p>
<h5 id="did"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#did">§</a> DID</h5>
<p>Using a DID for the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> is useful when using a mediator. The DID should be resolved, and services with type of “DIDComm” will contain valid <code>serviceEndpoints</code>. The keyAgreement keys of that DID Document should be appended at the end of the routingKeys section from the message recipient’s DID Document as per the process in [Sender Forward Process]. The key advantage with this approach is that a mediator can rotate keys and update serviceEndpoints without any updates needed to dependent recipients` DID Documents.</p>
<p>A DID representing a mediator SHOULD NOT use alternative endpoints in it’s own DID Document to avoid recursive endpoint resolution. Using only the URIs described in [transports] will prevent such recursion.</p>

<p>When passing a DIDComm Message between two parties, it is often useful to present a message in the form of a URL or encoded into the form of a QR code for scanning with a smartphone or other camera. The format for a QR code is simply the encoded URL form of a message.</p>

<p>First, no private information may be passed in the message. Private information should be passed between parties in encrypted messages only. Any protocol message that contains private information should not be passed via URL or QR code.</p>
<p>Second, any identifiers passed in a message sent via URL or QR code must no longer be considered private. Any DID used or other identifier no longer considered private MUST be rotated over a secure connection if privacy is required.</p>

<p>The items in the message are:</p>

<p>When encoding a message in a URL or QR code, the <em>sender</em> does not know which protocols are supported by the <em>recipient</em> of the message. Encoding multiple alternative messages is a form of optimistic protocol negotiation that allows multiple supported protocols without coordination</p>
<h5 id="standard-message-encoding"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#standard-message-encoding">§</a> Standard Message Encoding</h5>
<p>Using a standard message encoding allows for easier interoperability between multiple projects and software platforms. Using a URL for that standard encoding provides a built in fallback flow for users who are unable to automatically process the message. Those new users will load the URL in a browser as a default behavior, and may be presented with instructions on how to install software capable of processing the message. Already onboarded users will be able to process the message without loading in a browser via mobile app URL capture, or via capability detection after being loaded in a browser.</p>
<p>The standard message format is a URL with a Base64URLEncoded plaintext JWM json object as a query parameter.</p>
<p>The URL format is as follows, with some elements described below:</p>
<pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">https://&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?_oob=&lt;encodedplaintextjwm&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>&lt;domain&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> should be kept as short as possible, and the full URL should return human readable instructions when loaded in a browser. This is intended to aid new users. The <code>_oob</code> query parameter is required and is reserved to contain the DIDComm message string. Additional path elements or query parameters are allowed, and can be leveraged to provide coupons or other promise of payment for new users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>_oob</code> is a shortened form of Out of Band, and was chosen to not conflict with query parameter names in use at a particular domain. When the query parameter is detected, it may be assumed to be an Out Of Band message with a reasonably high confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To do: We need to rationalize this approach <code>https://</code> approach with the use of a special protocol (e.g. <code>didcomm://</code>) that will enable handling of the URL on mobile devices to automatically invoke an installed app on both Android and iOS. A user must be able to process the out-of-band message on the device of the agent (e.g. when the mobile device can’t scan the QR code because it is on a web page on device).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>&lt;encodedplaintextjwm&gt;</code> is a JWM plaintext message that has been base64-url encoded.</p>

<h5 id="short-url-message-retrieval"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#short-url-message-retrieval">§</a> Short URL Message Retrieval</h5>
<p>It seems inevitable that the length of some DIDComm messages will be too long to produce a useable QR code. Techniques to avoid unusable QR codes have been presented above, including using attachment links for requests, minimizing the routing of the response and eliminating unnecessary whitespace in the JSON. However, at some point a <em>sender</em> may need generate a very long URL. In that case, a short URL message retrieval redirection should be implemented by the sender as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sender should generate and track a GUID for the out-of-band message URL.</li>
<li>The shortened version should be:
<ul>
<li><code>https://example.com/path?_oobid=5f0e3ffb-3f92-4648-9868-0d6f8889e6f3</code></li>
<li>Note the replacement of the query parameter <code>_oob</code> with <code>_oobid</code> when using shortened URL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On receipt of this form of message, the agent must do an HTTP GET to retrieve the associated encoded  message.
<ul>
<li>A sender may want to wait to generate the full invitation until the redirection event of the shortened URL to the full length form dynamic, so a single QR code can be used for distinct messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A usable QR code will always be able to be generated from the shortened form of the URL.</p>
<p>Note: Due to the privacy implications, a standard URL shortening service SHOULD NOT be used.</p>

<p>DIDComm serves as a foundational layer for the development of protocols. This spec does not include protocols themselves, but describes the basic requirements and foundational elements.</p>
<p>Each Protocol is uniquely identified by a Protocol Identifier URI, and contains one or more messages identified by a Message Type URI. In addition to serving as a unique identifier, the URIs may be used by a developer to locate documentation.</p>
<h4 id="protocol-identifier-uri"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#protocol-identifier-uri">§</a> Protocol Identifier URI</h4>
<p>A Protocol Identifier URI identifies protocol versions unambiguously.  Additionally, Protocol Identifier URIs may be used by a developer to locate documentation about a protocol.</p>
<p>The URI must be composed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[doc-uri][delim][protocol-name]/[semver]
</code></pre>
<p>With ABNF:</p>
<pre class="language-ABNF"><code class="language-ABNF">protocol-identifier-uri = doc-uri delim protocol-name &quot;/&quot; semver
delim                   = &quot;?&quot; / &quot;/&quot; / &quot;&amp;&quot; / &quot;:&quot; / &quot;;&quot; / &quot;=&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Its loose matcher regex is:</p>
<pre><code>(.*?)([a-z0-9._-]+)/(\d[^/]*)/?$
</code></pre>
<p>Example Protocol Type URIs:</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/protocols?which=lets_do_lunch/1.0
http://example.com/protocols/lets_do_lunch/1.0
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-toolbox/tree/master/docs/admin-invitations/0.1
</code></pre>
<p>The goals of this URI are, in descending priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code can use the URI to route messages to protocol
handlers using <a href="semver.md">semver rules</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definition of a protocol should be tied to the URI such
that it is semantically stable. This means that once version 1.0
of a protocol is defined, its definition <a href="semver.md">should not change in
ways that would break implementations</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers can discover information about novel protocols, using
the URI to browse or search the web.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>doc-uri</code> portion is any URI that exposes documentation about
protocols. A developer should be able to browse to that URI and use human intelligence
to look up the named and versioned protocol.</p>
<h4 id="message-type-uri"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#message-type-uri">§</a> Message Type URI</h4>
<p>A <strong>Message Type URI</strong> identifies message types unambiguously.
Standardizing its format is important because it is parsed by agents that
will map messages to handlers–basically, code will look at this string and
say, “Do I have something that can handle this message type inside protocol
<em>X</em> version <em>Y</em>?” When that analysis happens, it must do more than compare
the string for exact equality; it may need to check for semver compatibility,
and it has to compare the protocol name and message type name ignoring case
and punctuation.</p>
<p>The URI MUST be composed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[protocol-identifier-uri] / [message-type-name]
</code></pre>
<p>With ABNF:</p>
<pre class="language-ABNF"><code class="language-ABNF">message-type-uri  = protocol-identifier-uri &quot;/&quot; message-type-name
protocol-identifier-uri = doc-uri delim protocol-name &quot;/&quot; semver
delim                   = &quot;?&quot; / &quot;/&quot; / &quot;&amp;&quot; / &quot;:&quot; / &quot;;&quot; / &quot;=&quot;
protocol-name     = identifier
protocol-version  = semver
message-type-name = identifier
identifier        = alpha *(*(alphanum / &quot;_&quot; / &quot;-&quot; / &quot;.&quot;) alphanum)
</code></pre>
<p>It can be loosely matched and parsed with the following regex:</p>
<pre><code>    (.*?)([a-z0-9._-]+)/(\d[^/]*)/([a-z0-9._-]+)$
</code></pre>
<p>A match will have captures groups of (1) = <code>doc-uri</code>, (2) = <code>protocol-name</code>,
(3) = <code>protocol-version</code>, and (4) = <code>message-type-name</code>.</p>
<p>The goals of this URI are, in descending priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the <code>protocol-identifier-uri</code> portion as described above.</li>
<li>Optionally and preferably, the full URI may produce a page of documentation about the specific message type, with no human mediation involved.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="discover-features-protocol-10"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#discover-features-protocol-10">§</a> Discover Features Protocol 1.0</h1>
<h2 id="summary-2"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#summary-2">§</a> Summary</h2>
<p>Describes how agents can query one another to discover which features
it supports, and to what extent.</p>
<h2 id="motivation"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#motivation">§</a> Motivation</h2>
<p>Though some agents will support just one protocol and will be
statically configured to interact with just one other party, many
exciting uses of agents are more dynamic and unpredictable. When
Alice and Bob meet, they won’t know in advance which features are
supported by one another’s agents. They need a way to find out.</p>
<h2 id="reference-2"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#reference-2">§</a> Reference</h2>
<p>This RFC introduces a protocol for discussing the protocols an agent
can handle. The identifier for the message family used by this protocol is
<code>discover-features</code>, and the fully qualified URI for its definition is:</p>
<pre><code>https://didcomm.org/discover-features/1.0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="roles-2"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#roles-2">§</a> Roles</h3>
<p>There are two roles in the <code>discover-features</code> protocol: <code>requester</code> and
<code>responder</code>. The requester asks the responder about the protocols it
supports, and the responder answers. Each role uses a single message type.</p>
<h3 id="states-2"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#states-2">§</a> States</h3>
<p>This is a classic two-step request~response interaction, so it uses the
predefined state machines for any <code>requester</code> and <code>responder</code>:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1smY8qhG1qqGs0NH9g2hV4b7mDqrM6MIsmNI93tor2qk/edit"><img src="state-machines.png" alt="state machines"></a></p>
<h3 id="messages-3"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#messages-3">§</a> Messages</h3>
<h5 id="query-message-type"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#query-message-type">§</a> <code>query</code> Message Type</h5>
<p>A <code>discover-features/query</code> message looks like this:</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://didcomm.org/discover-features/1.0/query"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token property">"id"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"yWd8wfYzhmuXX3hmLNaV5bVbAjbWaU"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token property">"body"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token property">"query"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://didcomm.org/tictactoe/1.*"</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Query messages say, “Please tell me what your capabilities are with
respect to the protocols that match this string.” This particular example
asks if another agent knows any 1.x versions of the tictactoe protocol.</p>
<p>The <code>query</code> field may use the * wildcard. By itself, a query with just
the wildcard says, “I’m interested in anything you want to share with
me.” But usually, this wildcard will be to match a prefix that’s a little
more specific, as in the example that matches any 1.x version.</p>
<p>Any agent may send another agent this message type at any time.
Implementers of agents that intend to support dynamic relationships
and rich features are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to implement support
for this message, as it is likely to be among the first messages
exchanged with a stranger.</p>
<h5 id="disclose-message-type"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#disclose-message-type">§</a> <code>disclose</code> Message Type</h5>
<p>A <code>discover-features/disclose</code> message looks like this:</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://didcomm.org/discover-features/1.0/disclose"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token property">"thread_id"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"yWd8wfYzhmuXX3hmLNaV5bVbAjbWaU"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token property">"body"</span><span class="token operator">:</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token property">"protocols"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>
            <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
                <span class="token property">"ptid"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://didcomm.org/tictactoe/1.0"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
                <span class="token property">"roles"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">"player"</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>
            <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">]</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>protocols</code> field is a JSON array of <strong>protocol support descriptor</strong>
objects that match the query. Each descriptor has a <code>pid</code> that contains
a protocol version (fully qualified message family identifier such as
<code>https://didcomm.org/tictactoe/1.0</code>), plus a <code>roles</code>
array that enumerates the roles the responding agent
can play in the associated protocol.</p>
<p>Response messages say, “Here are some protocols I support that matched
your query, and some things I can do with each one.”</p>
<h5 id="sparse-responses"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#sparse-responses">§</a> Sparse Responses</h5>
<p>Responses do not have to contain exhaustive detail. For example, the following
response is probably just as good:</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">"type"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://didcomm.org/discover-features/1.0/disclose"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="token property">"thread_id"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"yWd8wfYzhmuXX3hmLNaV5bVbAjbWaU"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="token property">"protocols"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token property">"ptid"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"https://didcomm.org/tictactoe/1.0"</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">]</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The reason why less detail probably suffices is that agents do not need to
know everything about one another’s implementations in order to start an
interaction–usually the flow will organically reveal what’s needed. For
example, the <code>outcome</code> message in the <code>tictactoe</code> protocol isn’t needed
until the end, and is optional anyway. Alice can start a tictactoe game
with Bob and will eventually see whether he has the right idea about
<code>outcome</code> messages.</p>
<p>The missing <code>roles</code> in this response does not say, “I support no roles
in this protocol.” It says, “I support the protocol but
I’m providing no detail about specific roles.”</p>
<p>Even an empty <code>protocols</code> map does not say, “I support no protocols
that match your query.” It says, “I’m not telling you that I support any
protocols that match your query.” An agent might not tell another that
it supports a protocol for various reasons, including: the trust that
it imputes to the other party based on cumulative interactions so far,
whether it’s in the middle of upgrading a plugin, whether it’s currently
under high load, and so forth. And responses to a <code>discover-features</code> request are
not guaranteed to be true forever; agents can be upgraded or downgraded,
although they probably won’t churn in their protocol support from moment
to moment.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-considerations-3"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#privacy-considerations-3">§</a> Privacy Considerations</h3>
<p>Because the regex in a <code>request</code> message can be very inclusive, the <code>discover-features</code>
protocol could be used to mine information suitable for agent fingerprinting,
in much the same way that browser fingerprinting works. This is antithetical
to the ethos of our ecosystem, and represents bad behavior. Agents should
use <code>discover-features</code> to answer legitimate questions, and not to build detailed
profiles of one another. However, fingerprinting may be attempted
anyway.</p>
<p>For agents that want to maintain privacy, several best practices are
recommended:</p>
<h5 id="follow-selective-disclosure"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#follow-selective-disclosure">§</a> Follow selective disclosure.</h5>
<p>Only reveal supported features based on trust in the relationship.
Even if you support a protocol, you may not wish to use it in
every relationship. Don’t tell others about protocols you do
not plan to use with them.</p>
<p>Patterns are easier to see in larger data samples. However, a pattern
of ultra-minimal data is also a problem, so use good judgment about
how forthcoming to be.</p>
<h1 id="trust-ping-protocol-10"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#trust-ping-protocol-10">§</a> Trust Ping Protocol 1.0</h1>
<p>A standard way for agents to test connectivity,
responsiveness, and security of a DIDComm channel.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-2"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#motivation-2">§</a> Motivation</h2>
<p>Agents are distributed. They are not guaranteed to be
connected or running all the time. They support a
variety of transports, speak a variety of protocols,
and run software from many different vendors.</p>
<p>This can make it very difficult to prove that two
agents have a functional pairwise channel. Troubleshooting
connectivity, responsiveness, and security is vital.</p>
<h2 id="reference-3"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#reference-3">§</a> Reference</h2>
<p>This protocol is analogous to the familiar <code>ping</code>
command in networking–but because it operates
over DIDComm, it is transport
agnostic and asynchronous, and it can produce insights
into privacy and security that a regular ping
cannot.</p>
<h3 id="roles-3"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#roles-3">§</a> Roles</h3>
<p>There are two parties in a trust ping: the <code>sender</code>
and the <code>receiver</code>. The sender initiates the trust
ping. The receiver responds. If the receiver wants
to do a ping of their own, they can, but this is a
new interaction in which they become the sender.</p>
<h3 id="protocol-type-uri"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#protocol-type-uri">§</a> Protocol Type URI</h3>
<p><code>https://didcomm.org/trust_ping/1.0</code></p>
<h3 id="messages-4"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#messages-4">§</a> Messages</h3>
<h4 id="ping"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#ping">§</a> ping</h4>
<p>The trust ping interaction begins when <code>sender</code>
creates a <code>ping</code> message like this:</p>
<pre class="language-JSON"><code class="language-JSON">{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;https://didcomm.org/trust_ping/1.0/ping&quot;,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;518be002-de8e-456e-b3d5-8fe472477a86&quot;,
  &quot;body&quot;: {
      &quot;response_requested&quot;: true
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>response_requested</strong>: default value is <code>true</code>. If false, the <code>sender</code> is not requesting a <code>ping_response</code> from the <code>receiver</code>. If <code>true</code>, the <code>sender</code> is requesting a response.</p>
<h4 id="ping_response"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#ping_response">§</a> ping_response</h4>
<p>When the message arrives at the receiver, assuming that <code>response_requested</code>
is not <code>false</code>, the receiver should reply as quickly as possible with a
<code>ping_response</code> message that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="language-JSON"><code class="language-JSON">{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;https://didcomm.org/trust_ping/1.0/ping_response&quot;,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;e002518b-456e-b3d5-de8e-7a86fe472847&quot;,
  &quot;thread_id&quot;: &quot;518be002-de8e-456e-b3d5-8fe472477a86&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="trust"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#trust">§</a> Trust</h3>
<p>This is the “<strong>trust</strong> ping protocol”, not just the “ping protocol.”
The “trust” in its name comes from several features that the interaction
gains by virtue of the properties of the DIDComm messages. A ping and response verify to both parties that the necessary encryption is in place and working properly for the messages to be understood.</p>
