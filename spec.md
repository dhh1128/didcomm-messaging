### Other Materials
So far, a lot of early content here is fairly raw. We are just beginning to organize it. We will be implementing a CI/CD process that turns disparate markdown docs into something that’s easy to browse -- maybe using github pages, maybe generating static HTML that’s published on DIF’s website, maybe something else. When we have that content available, this doc will go away.

In the meantime, here are a few additional resources that relate to the spec we’re writing.

* [Proposed Outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hn4ofl7ubRy22Xv1Yj1g77OkJWlWkDh88O3Od-yp8Cg/edit)
* [Tutorial on DIDComm Messaging in Hyperledger Aries](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm#aries-rfc-0005-did-communication)
* [Draft of JWM spec](https://github.com/mattrglobal/jwm) (used by DIDComm Messaging; will be referenced heavily in final spec)
